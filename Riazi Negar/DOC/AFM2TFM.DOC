   NAME
     afm2tfm - convert Adobe font metrics to TeX font metrics

   DESCRIPTION
     PostScript fonts are (or should be) accompanied by font metric files
     such as Times-Roman.afm, which describes the characteristics of the font
     called Times-Roman.  To use such fonts with TeX, we need TFM files that
     contain similar information. This program does that conversion.  For
     more information, print out the dvips manual.

   FILES
     _p_s_f_o_n_t_s._m_a_p in the config directory used by dvips (update this).
     ../_a_f_m/_M_a_k_e_f_i_l_e in the dvips sources (look at this for examples).

   SEE ALSO
     dvips(1), tex(1), vptovf(1)

   BUGS
     An option to add letterspacing to the virtual font was rejected by Knuth
     because it would make the fi and fl ligatures break the normal rhythmic
     pattern.
