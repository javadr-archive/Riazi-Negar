   NAME
     dvips - convert a TeX DVI file to PostScript

   SYNOPSIS
     dvips [ _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] _f_i_l_e[.dvi]

   DESCRIPTION
     The program dvips takes a DVI file _f_i_l_e[.dvi] produced by TeX (or by
     some other processor such as GFtoDVI) and converts it to PostScript,
     normally sending the result directly to the laserprinter.  The DVI file
     may be specified without the ._d_v_i extension.  Fonts used may either be
     resident in the printer or defined as bitmaps in PK files, or a `vir-
     tual' combination of both.  If the MakeTeXPK program is installed, dvips
     will automatically invoke METAFONT to generate fonts that don't already
     exist.

     For more information, see the manual _d_v_i_p_s._t_e_x in the TEXINPUTS direc-
     tory. The manual can be printed with the following commands:


          tex dvips
          dvips dvips -o dvips.ps
          lpr dvips.ps

   OPTIONS

     -a   Conserve memory by making three passes over the .dvi file instead
          of two and only loading those characters actually used.  Generally
          only useful on machines with a very limited amount of memory, like
          some PCs.

     -A   Print only odd pages (TeX pages, not sequence pages).

     -b num
          Generate _n_u_m copies of each page, but duplicating the page body
          rather than using the #_n_u_m_c_o_p_i_e_s option.  This can be useful in
          conjunction with a header file setting _c_h_a_r_9_2_b_o_p-_h_o_o_k to do color
          separations or other neat tricks.

     -B   Print only even pages (TeX pages, not sequence pages).

     -c num
          Generate _n_u_m copies of every page.  Default is 1.  (For collated
          copies, see the -_C option below.)

     -C num
          Create _n_u_m copies, but collated (by replicating the data in the
          PostScript file).  Slower than the -_c option, but easier on the
          hands, and faster than resubmitting the same PostScript file multi-
          ple times.

     -d num
          Set the debug flags.  This is intended only for emergencies or for


   TeXware                                                                  1

          unusual fact-finding expeditions; it will work only if _d_v_i_p_s has
          been compiled with the DEBUG option.  For more information on pos-
          sible values see section 15 of _d_v_i_p_s._t_e_x.

     -D num
          Set the resolution in dpi (dots per inch) to _n_u_m. This affects the
          choice of bitmap fonts that are loaded and also the positioning of
          letters in resident PostScript fonts. Must be between 10 and 10000.
          This affects both the horizontal and vertical resolution.  If a
          high resolution (something greater than 400 dpi, say) is selected,
          the -_Z flag should probably also be used.

     -e num
          Make sure that each character is placed at most this many pixels
          from its `true' resolution-independent position on the page. The
          default value of this parameter is resolution dependent.  Allowing
          individual characters to `drift' from their correctly rounded posi-
          tions by a few pixels, while regaining the true position at the
          beginning of each new word, improves the spacing of letters in
          words.

     -E   makes _d_v_i_p_s attempt to generate an EPSF file with a tight bounding
          box.  This only works on one-page files, and it only looks at marks
          made by characters and rules, not by any included graphics.  In
          addition, it gets the glyph metrics from the _t_f_m file, so charac-
          ters that lie outside their enclosing _t_f_m box may confuse it.  In
          addition, the bounding box might be a bit too loose if the charac-
          ter glyph has significant left or right side bearings.  Nonethe-
          less, this option works well for creating small EPSF files for
          equations or tables or the like.  (Note, of course, that _d_v_i_p_s out-
          put is resolution dependent and thus does not make very good EPSF
          files, especially if the images are to be scaled; use these EPSF
          files with a great deal of care.)

     -f   Read the ._d_v_i file from standard input and write the PostScript to
          standard output.  The standard input must be seekable, so it cannot
          be a pipe.  If you must use a pipe, write a shell script that
          copies the pipe output to a temporary file and then points _d_v_i_p_s at
          this file.  This option also disables the automatic reading of the
          _P_R_I_N_T_E_R environment variable, and turns off the automatic sending
          of control D if it was turned on with the -_F option or in the con-
          figuration file; use -_F after this option if you want both.

     -F   Causes Control-D (ASCII code 4) to be appended as the very last
          character of the PostScript file.  This is useful when _d_v_i_p_s is
          driving the printer directly instead of working through a spooler,
          as is common on extremely small systems.  NOTE! DO NOT USE THIS
          OPTION!

     -h name
          Prepend file _n_a_m_e as an additional header file. (However, if the
          name is simply `-' suppress all header files from the output.)
          This header file gets added to the PostScript _u_s_e_r_d_i_c_t.



   2                                                                  TeXware

     -i   Make each section be a separate file.  Under certain circumstances,
          _d_v_i_p_s will split the document up into `sections' to be processed
          independently; this is most often done for memory reasons.  Using
          this option tells _d_v_i_p_s to place each section into a separate file;
          the new file names are created replacing the suffix of the supplied
          output file name by a three-digit sequence number.  This option is
          most often used in conjunction with the -_S option which sets the
          maximum section length in pages.  For instance, some photo-
          typesetters cannot print more than ten or so consecutive pages
          before running out of steam; these options can be used to automati-
          cally split a book into ten-page sections, each to its own file.

     -k   Print crop marks.  This option increases the paper size (which
          should be specified, either with a paper size special or with the
          -_T option) by a half inch in each dimension.  It translates each
          page by a quarter inch and draws cross-style crop marks.  It is
          mostly useful with typesetters that can set the page size automati-
          cally.

     -K   This option causes comments in included PostScript graphics, font
          files, and headers to be removed.  This is sometimes necessary to
          get around bugs in spoolers or PostScript post-processing programs.
          Specifically, the %%Page comments,  when left in, often cause dif-
          ficulties.  Use of this flag can cause some included graphics to
          fail, since the PostScript header macros from some software pack-
          ages read portions of the input stream line by line, searching for
          a particular comment.  This option has been turned off by default
          because PostScript previewers and spoolers have been getting
          better.

     -l num
          The last page printed will be the first one numbered _n_u_m Default is
          the last page in the document.  If the _n_u_m is prefixed by an equals
          sign, then it (and any argument to the -_p option) is treated as a
          sequence number, rather than a value to compare with _c_h_a_r_9_2 _c_o_u_n_t_0
          values.  Thus, using -_l =_9 will end with the ninth page of the
          document, no matter what the pages are actually numbered.

     -m   Specify manual feed for printer.

     -M   Turns off the automatic font generation facility.  If any fonts are
          missing, commands to generate the fonts are appended to the file
          _m_i_s_s_f_o_n_t._l_o_g in the current directory; this file can then be exe-
          cuted and deleted to create the missing fonts.

     -n num
          At most _n_u_m pages will be printed. Default is 100000.

     -N   Turns off structured comments; this might be necessary on some sys-
          tems that try to interpret PostScript comments in weird ways, or on
          some PostScript printers.  Old versions of TranScript in particular
          cannot handle modern Encapsulated PostScript.

   TeXware                                                                  3

          The output will be sent to file _n_a_m_e If no file name is given, the
          default name is _f_i_l_e._p_s where the .dvi file was called _f_i_l_e._d_v_i; if
          this option isn't given, any default in the configuration file is
          used.  If the first character of the supplied output file name is
          an exclamation mark, then the remainder will be used as an argument
          to _p_o_p_e_n; thus, specifying !_l_p_r as the output file will automati-
          cally queue the file for printing.  This option also disables the
          automatic reading of the _P_R_I_N_T_E_R environment variable, and turns
          off the automatic sending of control D if it was turned on with the
          -_F option or in the configuration file; use -_F after this option if
          you want both.

     -O offset
          Move the origin by a certain amount.  The _o_f_f_s_e_t is a comma-
          separated pair of dimensions, such as ._1_i_n,-._3_c_m (in the same syn-
          tax used in the _p_a_p_e_r_s_i_z_e special).  The origin of the page is
          shifted from the default position (of one inch down, one inch to
          the right from the upper left corner of the paper) by this amount.

     -p num
          The first page printed will be the first one numbered _n_u_m. Default
          is the first page in the document.  If the _n_u_m is prefixed by an
          equals sign, then it (and any argument to the -_l option) is treated
          as a sequence number, rather than a value to compare with _c_h_a_r_9_2
          _c_o_u_n_t_0 values.  Thus, using -_p =_3 will start with the third page of
          the document, no matter what the pages are actually numbered.

     -pp pagelist
          A comma-separated list of pages and ranges (a-b) may be given,
          which will be interpreted as _c_h_a_r_9_2 _c_o_u_n_t_0 values.  Pages not
          specified will not be printed.  Multiple -pp options may be speci-
          fied or all pages and page ranges can be specified with one -pp
          option.

     -P printername
          Sets up the output for the appropriate printer.  This is imple-
          mented by reading in _c_o_n_f_i_g._p_r_i_n_t_e_r_n_a_m_e , which can then set the
          output pipe (as in, !_l_p_r -_P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r_n_a_m_e as well as the font paths
          and any other _c_o_n_f_i_g._p_s defaults for that printer only.  Note that
          _c_o_n_f_i_g._p_s is read before _c_o_n_f_i_g._p_r_i_n_t_e_r_n_a_m_e In addition, another
          file called ~/._d_v_i_p_s_r_c is searched for immediately after _c_o_n_f_i_g._p_s;
          this file is intended for user defaults.  If no -_P command is
          given, the environment variable _P_R_I_N_T_E_R is checked.  If that vari-
          able exists, and a corresponding configuration file exists, that
          configuration file is read in.

     -q   Run in quiet mode.  Don't chatter about pages converted, etc.;
          report nothing but errors to standard error.

     -r   Stack pages in reverse order.  Normally, page 1 will be printed
          first.

     -s   Causes the entire global output to be enclosed in a save/restore
          pair.  This causes the file to not be truly conformant, and is thus


   4                                                                  TeXware

          not recommended, but is useful if you are driving the printer
          directly and don't care too much about the portability of the out-
          put.

     -S num
          Set the maximum number of pages in each `section'.  This option is
          most commonly used with the -_i option; see that documentation above
          for more information.

     -t papertype
          This sets the paper type to _p_a_p_e_r_t_y_p_e. The _p_a_p_e_r_t_y_p_e _s_h_o_u_l_d _b_e
          _d_e_f_i_n_e_d _i_n _o_n_e the appropriate code to select it.  (Currently known
          types include _l_e_t_t_e_r, _l_e_g_a_l, _l_e_d_g_e_r, _a_4, _a_3, ) You can also specify
          -_t _l_a_n_d_s_c_a_p_e, which rotates a document by 90 degrees.  To rotate a
          document whose size is not letter, you can use the -_t option twice,
          once for the page size, and once for landscape.  The upper left
          corner of each page in the ._d_v_i file is placed one inch from the
          left and one inch from the top.  Use of this option is highly
          dependent on the configuration file.  Note that executing the
          _l_e_t_t_e_r or _a_4 or other PostScript operators cause the document to be
          nonconforming and can cause it not to print on certain printers, so
          the paper size should not execute such an operator if at all possi-
          ble.

     -T offset
          Set the paper size to the given pair of dimensions.  This option
          takes its arguments in the same style as -_O. It overrides any paper
          size special in the dvi file.

     -U   Disable a PostScript virtual memory saving optimization that stores
          the character metric information in the same string that is used to
          store the bitmap information.  This is only necessary when driving
          the Xerox 4045 PostScript interpreter.  It is caused by a bug in
          that interpreter that results in `garbage' on the bottom of each
          character.  Not recommended unless you must drive this printer.

     -x num
          Set the magnification ratio to _n_u_m /1000. Overrides the magnifica-
          tion specified in the .dvi file.  Must be between 10 and 100000.

     -X num
          Set the horizontal resolution in dots per inch to _n_u_m.

     -Y num
          Set the vertical resolution in dots per inch to _n_u_m.

     -Z   Causes bitmapped fonts to be compressed before they are downloaded,
          thereby reducing the size of the PostScript font-downloading infor-
          mation.  Especially useful at high resolutions or when very large
          fonts are used.  Will slow down printing somewhat, especially on
          early 68000-based PostScript printers.
