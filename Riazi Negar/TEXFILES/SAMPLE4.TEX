\section{Introduction}
This is a very simple example to illustrate that the same
package can be used to run both english and farsi latex
at the same time. 

Here we just include a few lines and a very simple equation
\begin{equation}
x_1+y_2=z_3^2
\end{equation}

As you should know by now, to use the english version, you just
need to begin the {\tt TEXSHELL} program with the {\tt /e} option as
follows:
\begin{quotation}
{\tt TEXSHELL /e }
\end{quotation}

Note that for the farsi version, you do not need to include any
option on the command line.  The {\tt TEXSHELL} program has several 
other options that can be used to run the \TeX{} 
package with differnt format files.
