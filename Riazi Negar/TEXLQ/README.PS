To install dvips, change your current working directory to the
root directory of Farsi-LaTeX package.  The TEXROOT environment
variable points to this root directory.  Then put dvips diskette
in drive A: and type the following DOS command:

XCOPY /S A:*.*

You can also use the B: drive.

For using dvips, you have to set the TEXCONFIG environment variable.
To do this just add the following line:

SET TEXCONFIG=%TEXROOT%\PS

to the batch file SETTEXDF.BAT.  You can find this file in the root
directory pointed by TEXROOT environment variable.

You may also need to modify the CONFIG.PS FILE that is located in
PS subdirectory of the root directory (the same directory that
is pointed by the TEXCONFIG environment variable).  You have
to modify this file if the name of your root directory is something
other than C:\TEXXET; otherwise, you do not need to change anything.

Note that if you are using a 32 bit machine, rename DVIPS32.EXE
as DVIPS.EXE.  This will improve the performance of the program.
Also, the ordinary DVIPS program (that works even on XT) is limited
to 640K of DOS lower memory; hence, for processing complex files,
you have to use the -a switch to conserve memory and make the program 
running. The 32 bit version does not have this limitaion and will use 
all available memory.
